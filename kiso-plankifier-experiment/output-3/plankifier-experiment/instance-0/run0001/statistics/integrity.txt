# Integrity Statistics Breakdown
# Type           - the type of integrity metric.
                check - means checksum was compared for a file,
                compute - means a checksum was generated for a file
# File Type      - the type of file: input or output from a job perspective
# Count          - the number of times done
# Total Duration - sum of duration in seconds for the 'count' number
                of records matching the particular type,
                file-type combo
