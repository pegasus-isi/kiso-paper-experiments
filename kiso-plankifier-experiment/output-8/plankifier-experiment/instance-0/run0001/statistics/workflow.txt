# Workflow summary
#   Summary of the workflow execution. It shows total
#   tasks/jobs/sub workflows run, how many succeeded/failed etc.
#   In case of hierarchical workflow the calculation shows the
#   statistics of each individual sub workflow.The file also
#   contains a 'Total' table at the bottom which is the cummulative
#   of all the individual statistics details.t shows the following
#   statistics about tasks, jobs and sub workflows.
#
#     * WF Retries - number of times a workflow was retried.
#     * Succeeded - total count of succeeded tasks/jobs/sub workflows.
#     * Failed - total count of failed tasks/jobs/sub workflows.
#     * Incomplete - total count of tasks/jobs/sub workflows that are
#       not in succeeded or failed state. This includes all the jobs
#       that are not submitted, submitted but not completed etc. This
#       is calculated as  difference between 'total' count and sum of
#       'succeeded' and 'failed' count.
#     * Total - total count of tasks/jobs/sub workflows.
#     * Retries - total retry count of tasks/jobs/sub workflows.
#     * Total+Retries - total count of tasks/jobs/sub workflows executed
#       during workflow run. This is the cumulative of retries,
#       succeeded and failed count.
